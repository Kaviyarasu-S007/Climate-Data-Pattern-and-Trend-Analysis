# Climate Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of historical climate data to uncover patterns and trends, providing valuable insights into weather conditions over time. The analysis will be conducted using various data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Data Source

The primary source of data for this project is uploaded in this repository. Ensure that the data is reliable, up-to-date, and covers a significant timeframe for meaningful analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Visualization library called plotly

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Downloaded the historical climate data from kaggle.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing or inconsistent data.
   - Converted data types wherever necessary.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

8. **Rainfall Analysis:**
   The graph shows that there is a lot of variability in daily precipitation throughout the years. There are some days with no precipitation at all, while others have over 1.5 inches of rain. However, there 
   is no clear trend in the data over time.

   Here are some specific observations I can make about the data:

  The wettest year was 2019, with a total of 48.24 inches of precipitation.

  The driest year was 2020, with a total of 25.43 inches of precipitation.

  There is a lot of variability in precipitation within each year. For example, in 2019, there were several days with over 1 inch of rain, but there were also several months with no precipitation at all.
  Overall, this graph shows that daily precipitation in Chennai, India is highly variable and there is no clear trend over time.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kaviyarasu-S007/climate-data-analysis.git
   ```

2. Follow the Jupyter Notebooks in the specified order for a step-by-step walkthrough of the analysis.
